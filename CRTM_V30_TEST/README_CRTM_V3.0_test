One hundred profiles (either clear-sky or cloudy (overcast or partial cloud) ) including dust 
aerosol profile over various surface types are selected for the first check of the CRTM V3.0.

The Test_CRTM_V30 may serve as the first check for users to check your results
against the reference calculations (big_endian format) in ./Results .

The user can change the value for the parameter "Test_Case" at line 61 for a sensor id.
The user may modify code lines 63 - 65 for desired check.

The Test_CRTM_V30 can be also used by Developers for checking the consistency:
  a. finite forward difference against tangent-linear (change line 67 to true)
  b. tangent-linear against adjoint (change line 68 to true)
  c. adjoint against K-matrix (change line 69 to true)
  
The developers may change line 70
  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: n1 = 1, n2 = 100, n_profile_step = 1 !start and end profile
for all or few or one profile.



To run the code,
1. Build libcrtm.a
  You may read README file from the CRTM release to build the library. Below is only a
  simple and manual method when you link the source codes to src/Build/libsrc
  
cd src/Build/libsrc
  modify line 28 in Makefile_mp_nc_intel or Makefile_mp_nc_g54
      to use netcdf and hdf5 libraries.
  If you have default netcdf and hdf5 on your computer, you need to remove the netcdf
    and hdf5 from the line 28
    
2. Run the test 
   cd CRTM_V30_TEST
   ulimit -s unlimited   (if needed)
   make clean
   make intel  (make sure netcdf library is also activated here)
   Test_CRTM_V30
   
   If you use gfortran, comment out
   the makefile lines 31 and 32, use lines 34 and 35


Hope the test code can be useful for you.
